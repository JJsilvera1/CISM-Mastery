    "justification": {
      "A": "Although statistical anomaly IDS must continually compare current activity against a learned baseline, which does require more CPU cycles than a simple signature match, this overhead is not the chief reason for their limited use.",
      "B": "Anomaly IDS do compare measurements to a baseline, so minor metric changes can cause some false positives, but this effect is secondary to other concerns.",
      "C": "These systems build a statistical profile of typical traffic and resource usage. When legitimate behavior varies widely—such as periods of idle use followed by bursts of heavy packet flow—the profile is frequently exceeded, producing numerous false alarms. This propensity for excessive alerts is the most detrimental drawback.",

It combines at least two of the three classic factors—something you know (e.g., a password), something you have (e.g., a token or smart card), and something you are (e.g., a biometric).

      "B": "A high FAR allows a large number of unauthorized individuals to be accepted, directly compromising the confidentiality of the data‑center. This setting is only acceptable when security is a lower priority than usability, which is not the case here.",
      "C": "When the sensitivity slider is moved, FRR and FAR move in opposite directions. Setting the system to operate below the equal‑error (crossover) point forces the FAR to drop below the crossover value, thereby minimizing the likelihood of false accepts at the cost of a higher FRR. For a high‑security facility, reducing false accepts is the priority, so this is the preferred setting.",
      "D": "Tuning to the exact equal‑error point balances FRR and FAR, giving the same probability of false rejects and false accepts.

      "A": "While impact analysis can help gauge business repercussions after an event, it does not speed up the initial discovery of the incident.",
      "B": "Hiring more reviewers raises costs and does not guarantee that critical events will be spotted faster; manual overload can still cause oversights.",
      "C": "Reducing the number of logged events may inadvertently suppress useful indicators, increasing the chance that an incident goes unnoticed.",
